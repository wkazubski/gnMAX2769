1. Software required

To build software on Linux system the recent version (3.5.0 or later) of SDCC
compiler is needed:

http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/

To install the software, the fxload utility is needed:

There is good chance that your favorite Linux distribution already has suitable
packages, so you can install them with a package installer. If not you have to
build them (and possibly their dependiences) from source.


2. Building software

To build the firmware, enter the src directory and do:

make

The file "gnMAX2769_firmware.hex" should appear in this directory if everyhing went correctly 
To install the hex file to bin directory, run:

make install

After this, to clean the build directory, run:

make clean

This will remove all built files (except the hex file installed to bin directory).


3. Installing the firmware to the board

Installing the binary to RAM (voliatile):

fxload -t fx2 -I bin/gnMAX2769_firmware.hex -D `./getdevpath -v 04b4 -p 8613`

Installing the binary to boot EEPROM (permanent):

fxload -t fx2 -I bin/gnMAX2769_firmware.hex -s loader/Vend_Ax.hex -c 0x01 -D `./getdevpath -v 04b4 -p 8613`

If the board was previously programmed, replace the -v and -p parameters with actual 
VID and PID of the board.
